      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        We are partnering with leading code schools to provide remote job training to help refugees land jobs as junior web developers (salaries starting around £25,000).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each apprentice is paired with a life mentor whom they meet in person at least once a week. This allows apprentices to navigate through potentially challenging circumstances while developing their skills as web developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are working with our code school partners to create a portfolio of hiring partners who offer guaranteed interviews at the end of the course with opportunities for full-time employability.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide specialized training for our mentors who work with refugees so that we can <strong>nuture well-being</strong> and <strong>self-confidence</strong> as well as <strong>employability</strong>. Being proficient in English is currently a pre-requisite, but we are constantly working to broaden the languages of our mentor group in order to support a more diverse community of apprentices.
      </p>

      <h2>First Cohort: March 2016</h2>
      <p>
        For our first cohort, we will be partnering with a world-class code school in London called Maker’s Academy who has offered places for Prosper Academy apprentices to attend their immersive online course called Ronin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ronin is remote, intensive and provides apprentices with everything they need to land their first job as a junior web developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Maker’s Academy curriculum is based upon recognised industry standards and has successfully launched web development careers for hundreds of students from around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prosper Academy will support apprentices through applying to Maker’s Academy, preparing for the interview, completing the pre-coursework material, and successfully completing the Ronin curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in landing a job as a junior web developer, Prosper Academy is a place where you can enter as you are and leave with the confidence of knowing the beauty of your future that lies ahead.
