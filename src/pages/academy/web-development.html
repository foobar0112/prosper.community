      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Web Development track at Prosper Academy is an apprenticeship for budding developers who want to grow their skills and maturity through contributing to refugee crisis projects.
      </p>

      <h3>custom curriculum</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than study a set curriculum like other design courses, our apprentices work with a career coach to develop a custom <a href="#skill-plan">skill plan</a> based upon their design experience, career goals and lifestyle needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a custom skill plan in place, the apprentice gains experience and maturity through collaborating with other developers and designers on a <a href="/#projects">Prosper Project</a>. Every week, the apprentice gets to meet with their mentor and the project team. The program structure allows apprentices to learn how to work in an Agile environment and how to design web-based products with Lean methodologies.

      <h2>Skill Plans</h2>
      <p>
        While we do create custom skill plans for each apprentice, we have found it helpful to provide some sample skill plans for apprentices to pick and choose the types of skills they'd like to learn. Feel free to use these plans as a reference for the type of plan you'll customize with your career coach when you start the program.
