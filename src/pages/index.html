        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Prosper emerged out of one designer's response to the human suffering of the refugee crisis in Europe. Since launching in October 2015, a global community of skilled digital workers has centralized around a single mission:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>To transform the refugee crisis into an opportunity to foster a new Europe&mdash;a society where every person is cherished and prosperity abounds.</strong>

      <h2>Open-Source Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Prosper Projects are a focal point of our community. They are a combination of human-centered design and open source technology and are built and maintained by online volunteers from all over the world. Each Prosper Project is designed to fulfill a few criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve a <strong>real human problem</strong> of the <strong>refugee crisis</strong></li>
        <li>Be <strong>sustainable</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> and <strong>significant</strong></li>
        <li>Solutions must be <strong>measurable</strong></li>
      </ul>

          <h4 class="subheader">A program for refugees who want to land full-time jobs as digital workers in Europe.</h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
          In a sector that has more jobs than people to fill them, we've designed a solution for refugees to participate in world-class job training while transitioning to a new life in Europe. Rather than settle for stacking shelves, our apprentices are learning the craft that drives leading businesses around the world: Creating user-centered applications on the web.
