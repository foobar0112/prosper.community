      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Prosper emerged out of one designer's response to the human suffering of the refugee crisis in Europe. Since launching in October 2015, a global community of skilled digital workers has centralized around a single mission:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>To transform the refugee crisis into an opportunity to foster an integrated society where every person is cherished and prosperity abounds.</strong>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Our projects are a combination of human-centered design and open source technology. They are the focal point of our community. Each project must fulfill several requirements before being taken on by our team:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Solve a <strong>real human problem</strong> of the <strong>refugee crisis</strong></li>
          <li>Be <strong>sustainable</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> and <strong>significant</strong></li>
          <li>Solutions must be <strong>measurable</strong></li>

          <h2>Introducing Prosper Academy:</h2>
          <h4 class="subheader">An online apprenticeship for designers and developers to grow their skills through contributing to refugee crisis projects.</h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
           After launching Prosper, we learned that there's a global community of designers and developers that have enough skills to contribute to a project but lack the experience to launch a meaningful career. Some of the members of this community are <strong>citizens</strong>, and some are <strong>refugees</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prosper Academy is our response to this community's needs.
