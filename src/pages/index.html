           After launching Prosper, we learned that there's a global community of designers and developers that have enough skills to contribute to a project but lack the experience to launch a meaningful career. Some of the members of this community are <strong>citizens</strong>, and some are <strong>refugees</strong>.

          Prosper Academy is our response to this community's needs.
