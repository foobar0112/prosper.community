      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Before committing to <a href="http://refugeeprojects.com/">RefugeeProjects.com</a> as our first project, we spent six weeks researching the vast array of problems that plagued the refugee crisis. We spoke to refugees, volunteers, and organizations who were providing aid on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a difficult and painful research process. We witnessed atrocities unlike anything we'd ever seen before. We realized that no matter what we decide to do, that it cannot simply be a 'project'. There were thousands of people dying, people forced to flee from their homes at gunpoint, women and children making treacherous unsupported journeys on foot&mdash;the list goes on...
      </p>
      <p>
        The refugee crisisd was not a problem that could be 'solved' using technology and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not a normal design process where we could look objectively at all the pieces of the puzzle and gain insights like a detective. This was an entirely different scenario than anything our team had approached before.
      </p>
      <p>
      We had to take care to mitigate major concerns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obstructing critical aid</li>
        <li>Creating more problems for people on the ground</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After speaking to dozens of people across Europe, we realized that there was one overarching problem that would allow us to enter into the refugee crisis and provide a solution that met all of our requirements and mitigated all of our concerns.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
      <p>
        The problem was this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Initiatives addressing the refugee crisis are scattered all across the web. This makes it difficult for <strong>refugees</strong>, <strong>volunteers</strong>, and <strong>donors</strong> to find exactly what they are looking for and leads to duplication of efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is our journey to solve this problem.
