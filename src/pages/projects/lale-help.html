      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Lale emerged out of a retired software engineer's efforts to help refugees in his local community. Ralf Schroeder had decades of experience building enterprise software and working with development teams to solve complex problems with scalable, robust solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Ralf witnessed the tangled mess of volunteer coordination on the ground amidst the refugee crisis, he decided he had to do something.
      </p>
      <p>
        After researching and not finding any suitable solutions, Ralf committed to create a web application that would change the way volunteers work together to help refugees. He called his application '<em>Lale</em>' (Pashtun for community). Lale is a complete task management system for volunteer communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built with Ruby on Rails, Lale is one of the most robust and well architected grassroots applications that we have discovered amidst the refugee crisis. Not only has Ralf been managing and supporting Lale in his own time and by his own means, but he has also continued working with local communities helping refugees.
