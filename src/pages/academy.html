      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
         After launching Prosper, we learned that there's a growing community of refugees who have received asylum in Europe and are looking to build their skills in the digital sector so they can earn higher paying jobs and give back to the society that welcomed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've designed Prosper Academy as a solution for refugees to participate in world-class job training while transitioning to a new life in Europe. Rather than settle for stacking shelves, our apprentices learn the craft that drives leading businesses around the world: Creating user-centered applications on the web.
      </p>

        <h4>First Cohort: March 2016</h4>
        <p>
          Prosper has had the pleasure of partnering with <a href="http://www.breaking-barriers.co.uk/">Breaking Barriers</a> and <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> to pilot Prosper Academy with a small cohort of refugees in London. The pilot will provide an opportunity for refugees to learn how to code and become junior web developers through an online course called <a href="http://ronin.makersacademy.com/">Ronin</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-coursework for the program starts March 14<sup>th</sup> 2016.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Prosper Academy is a 16&ndash;week program that provides world-class job training for refugees who want to learn the craft of web development and land their first job in the industry. The program consists of two major parts:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#remote">Remote job training</a></li>
          <li><a href="#in-person">In-person mentorship</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 id="remote">Remote Job Training</h3>
      <p>
        Our remote job training is delivered by one of our content partners, world-class design/code schools. Each of our content partners provide curriculum to Prosper Academy apprentices through an online platform with the support of an expert mentor whom apprentices meet at least once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        We intentionally use online platforms to help refugees land jobs in the digital sector. The recent explosion of design/coding bootcamps worldwide has paved the way for a new type of education: One that is affordable, online, and contains everything you need to launch your career as a skilled digital worker.
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of relationshp allows our content partners to provide job training for refugees through Prosper Academy in a way that is low-cost, scalable, and highly effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 2015 study reported an <strong>average salary increase of 38%</strong> for bootcamp graduates, and we aim to achieve well over 60% job placement for our Prosper Academy apprentices&mdash;something that current job training programs simply cannot offer refugees in Europe.
      </p>

      <h4>Two Tracks:</h4>
      <p>
        We've decided to open two initial tracks for Prosper Academy: User Experience Design, and Web Development&mdash;two of the foundational disciplines in the craft of building user-centered applications.

      <h3 id="in-person">In-Person Mentorship</h3>
      <p>
        We understand that our apprentices at Prosper Academy might be dealing with a lot of challenges: learning a new language, adapting to a new culture, and training for a new career. That's why we've designed a structured in-person mentorship to help refugees navigate through learning how to code and landing their first job as web developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of our in-person mentors have been trained specifically to support people who might be dealing with challenging circumstances. We've also designed a measurement framework to track our apprentice's growth through both hard and soft skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        In creating other academies that support people from challenging circumstances, we've witnessed the importance of consistent and deep human relationships. We believe there is no substitute to real social connection and that is a key element in the framework we've designed for Prosper Academy to support refugees on their journey to full-time employment in the digital sector.
      </p>

      <h2>Partners Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        We're excited by the prospect of scaling out Prosper Academy to a number of content partners and referral providers. If you're a design/code school interested in working with refugees, or if you're an NGO who has refugees that need job training please get in touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we are constantly deepening relationships with hiring partners who are socially-conscious companies who want to invest in the talent that graduates from Prosper Academy. If you think your company could be a good fit for our program, we'd love to discuss further.
