      <p>
         After launching Prosper, we learned that there's a large community of designers and developers that have enough skills to contribute to a project but lack the experience to launch a meaningful career.
      </p>

      <p>
        We realized in talking to members of this community that we needed to take a different approach to serving their needs. Rather than prescribe a set curriculum to help people grow, we've chosen to work with each apprentice to define a <strong>custom skill plan</strong> that reflects their needs and experience. This allows each apprentice to grow in the directtion and manner that suits them best.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a skill plan in place, we match apprentices to real tasks on <a href="#projects">Prosper projects</a>. This allows apprentices to <strong>learn by doing</strong> with the support of an <strong>expert mentor</strong> and community of peers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structure reflects our belief that people learn best when they:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>are <strong>driven by passion</strong> and</li>
        <li>can collaborate with other professionals on <strong>meaningful projects</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>our solution</h3>
      <p>
        We've designed a custom platform where apprentices (citizens and refugees alike):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Work with a career coach to define a <strong>custom skill plan</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborate with an interdisciplinary team on <strong>real projects</strong> within the refugee crisis
        </li>
        <li>
          Meet weekly with an <strong>expert mentor</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Use design and technology to <strong>solve real problems</strong> for real people </li>
        <li>
          Learn to <strong>articulate decisions</strong> to the project team
        </li>
        <li>Gain relevant experience and contacts to <strong>land a dream job</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Two Tracks</h4>
      <p>
         Because most of our apprentices already have experience in the industry and are looking to gain specialized skills, we've structured our course as two parallel tracks that collaborate with one another on <a href="#projects">Prosper projects</a>:

        <h3>bursary program for refugees</h3>
        <p>
          We've designed a program to support refugees with financing and life mentors as they attend Prosper Academy. We are sensitive to the fact that our bursary applicants may have unique lifestyle obstacles. Our bursary program is designed to create the right environment for you to grow your skills and land your first job in Europe as a web developer or UX designer.

      <h4>A Pilot for the Prosper Academy Bursary Program</h4>
      <p>
