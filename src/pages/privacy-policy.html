      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Prosper (&quot;<strong>Prosper</strong>&quot;) operates prosper.community and may operate other websites. It is Prosper&apos;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
        collect while operating our websites.</p>
      <h3>website visitors</h3>
      <p>Like most website operators, Prosper collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
        time of each visitor request. Prosper&apos;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Prosper&apos;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Solve The Refugee
        Crisis may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Prosper also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on blogs/sites. Prosper only discloses logged in user and
        commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
        where the comment was left.</p>
      <h3>gathering of personally-identifying information</h3>
      <p>Certain visitors to Prosper&apos;s websites choose to interact with Prosper in ways that require Prosper to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Solve
        The Refugee Crisis gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a href=http://www.prosper.community>prosper.community</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage
        in transactions with Prosper are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Prosper collects such
        information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&apos;s interaction with Prosper. Prosper does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
        below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
      <h3>aggregated statistics</h3>
      <p>Prosper may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Prosper may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Prosper does not disclose personally-identifying
        information other than as described below.</p>
      <h3>protection of certain personally-identifying information</h3>
      <p>Prosper discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
        Prosper&apos;s behalf or to provide services available at Prosper&apos;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
        located outside of your home country; by using Prosper&apos;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Prosper will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Prosper discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
        subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Prosper believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Prosper, third parties or the public at large.
        If you are a registered user of an Prosper website and have supplied your email address, Prosper may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
        with what&apos;s going on with Prosper and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
        or to help us support other users. Prosper takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
      <h3>cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&apos;s computer, and that the visitor&apos;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Prosper uses cookies to help Prosper
        identify and track visitors, their usage of Prosper website, and their website access preferences. Prosper visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies
        before using Prosper&apos;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Prosper&apos;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
      <h3>business transfers</h3>
      <p>If Prosper, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Prosper goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
        by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Prosper may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
      <h3>ads</h3>
      <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about
        you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Solve The Refugee
        Crisis and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
      <h3>privacy policy changes</h3>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Prosper may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Prosper&apos;s sole discretion. Prosper encourages visitors to frequently check this page
        for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a prosper.community account, you might also receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
        acceptance of such change.</p>
