      <h4>&#x25a2; Read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HI4tN2zUqSEuFFMmoEuTkout49VioOnjyyzoxJdPTs0/">RefugeeProjects Brief</a></h4>
      <p>
        Please read through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HI4tN2zUqSEuFFMmoEuTkout49VioOnjyyzoxJdPTs0/">RefugeeProjects Brief</a> to learn about our first and only active Prosper Project. If you don't read this carefully, it might be difficult to understand what is going on. Each checklist item below assumes you have read the brief.
      </p>

      <h4>&#x25a2; Join Prosper on Trello</h4>
      <p>
        Along with the invitation email, you should also receive an email to join the <a href="https://trello.com/prospercommunity">Prosper Community Team on Trello</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          We recommend bookmarking the <a href="https://trello.com/b/CfwoEGLi/prosper-refugeeprojects">Prosper â€” RefugeeProjects Trello Board</a> on your favorite browser.
        </strong>Easily accessing this board is essential to contributing as a volunteer!
      </p>
      <p>
        Trello is the tool that we use to manage projects. We have one Trello board for each project. To learn more about Trello and the tools we use, you might want to read through <a href="/playbook.html#tools">Prosper Playbook: Tools</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>&#x25a2; Comment on a Trello Card in the Backlog </h4>
      <p>
        Open up the <a href="https://trello.com/b/CfwoEGLi/prosper-refugeeprojects">Prosper &mdash; RefugeeProjects Trello Board</a> and comment on one of the cards in the 'Backlog'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commenting on a card lets us know you're up and running with Trello and you know how to comment&mdash;one of the key functionalities of working with teams on Trello.
      </p>

      </p>
      </ul>

      <h4>&#x25a2; Join Prosper on Slack</h4>
      <p>
        Along with inviting you to join Trello, we will also send you an invitation to join the <a href="https://prosper-community.slack.com">Prosper Community Team on Slack</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>We recommend <a href="https://slack.com/downloads">downloading the Slack app</a> on your computer and your phone. It's a great app and will make communicating much easier!</strong>
       </p>
       <p>
         Slack is the tool that we use to communicate with other team members in real-time. Using Slack for the first time can be a bit intimidating: There are lots of conversations going on at the same time. Don't worry! This is just the nature of the tool.
       </p>
       <p>
         Slack can be a bit of a double-edged sword at times. On one hand, you can send a message and ask for help and receive a message almost instantly. On the other hand, it can be difficult to digest all the information at once. Never fear! That's where our

      <h4>&#x25a2; Introduce yourself on Slack</h4>
      <p>
        Once you've joined the <a href="https://prosper-community.slack.com">Prosper Community Team on Slack</a>, pleae introduce yourself in the <a href="https://prosper-community.slack.com/messages/introductions/">#introductions</a> channel. It's good for everyone to know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who you are</li>
        <li>Why you joined</li>
        <li>What skills / experience you have to offer</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>&#x25a2; Assign yourself to a task in Trello</h4>
      <p>
        Open up the <a href="https://trello.com/b/CfwoEGLi/prosper-refugeeprojects">Prosper &mdash; RefugeeProjects Trello Board</a> and find a task that you'd like to take ownership of. Assign yourself to the task and move it into 'In Progress'.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can comment on the card and ask if anyone else would like to work on this with you. Also, it is helpful to assign yourself a due date so that we know when you'd like to have this task completed by.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're having trouble adding yourself a task, take a look at <a href="http://help.trello.com/article/807-adding-a-member-to-a-card">Trello Help: Adding a member to a card</a>. If you're having trouble adding a due date, see <a href="http://help.trello.com/article/794-adding-due-dates-to-cards">Trello Help: Adding due dates to cards</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>&#x25a2; Complete the task, ask for review</h4>
      <p>
        Now that you've assigned yourself to a task and given yourself a due date, it would be great if you could complete the task. Once the task is complete, move it to 'In Review' by clicking and dragging the card.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a specific member you'd like to review the task, please add them to the card and mention their name in a comment. If you need the task reviewed by a certain date, update the due date and let them know this in your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the task has been reviewed and your contribution has been accepted, the reviewer will move the task to 'Complete'. Congratulations! You've made your first contribution to a Prosper Project.
      </p>

      <h3>bonus</h3>
      <h4>&#x25a2; Share what you've learned</h4>
      <p>
        If you learned anything while completing the task, it would be great to share what you learned. You can send a public message on Slack, or if you'd prefer to send something anonymously, please <a href="/feedback.html">provide some feedback</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that everyone has something to teach and something to learn. By encouraging our new team members to share what they learn in making their first contribution, we are fostering a learning culture that will help all of us grow.
