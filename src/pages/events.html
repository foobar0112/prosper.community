        <h5 class="subheader">with john ellison, maria tarokh and jack ahmed</h5>
        <p class="lead">Wednesday March 9<sup>th</sup> 2016, 7&ndash;9:30pm | <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3bvrWHHBQR12">One Church Gloucester Place

        <p>Migration has been all over the news over the last few months - you can't have failed to miss it on virtually a daily basis. It's been represented in a variety of ways, talked about endlessly, kicked around as a political football, been demonised and lifted up, lamented and encouraged. In the midst of all of that it is easy to become de-sensitised to it, to only see the arguments and discussions and stances whilst forgetting that this actual reality for millions of people, not just in Europe but across the globe.
        </p>

        <p>For this month's event we want to think about the humans behind the headlines, to take it beyond the news and hear from people who have journeyed with this themselves and met others along the way. We are so pleased to have three fantastic speakers who will be sharing with us - <a href="http://john-ellison.com/">John Ellison</a>, Maria Tarokh and Jack Ahmed. You can read their bios further down the page.</p>

        <p class="lead">Monday February 22<sup>nd</sup> 2016, 7&ndash;9:30pm | <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HMuktUvBg1u">68 Middle street, Brighton</a></p>

        <p>As a takeaway from last month's meetup, we decided to focus February's event on centralizing refugee crisis efforts across Sussex (free food and drink will be provided by our sponsors).</p>

        <p>We are hoping to hear from a variety of refugee community organizations with the ultimate aim of creating a broader community of support to help refugees prosper in Brighton and Sussex.</p>
