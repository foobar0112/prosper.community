        <p class="lead">Monday February 22<sup>nd</sup> 2016, 7&ndash;9:30pm | <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HMuktUvBg1u">68 Middle street, Brighton</a></p>

        <p>As a takeaway from last month's meetup, we decided to focus February's event on centralizing refugee crisis efforts across Sussex (free food and drink will be provided by our sponsors).</p>

        <p>We are hoping to hear from a variety of refugee community organizations with the ultimate aim of creating a broader community of support to help refugees prosper in Brighton and Sussex.</p>
